# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Knowledge Sharing
* Feel free to share knowledge in the group that will add value to the community.
* While sharing the knowledge in the form of a document, please do your due dilligence on any potential confidentiality breach. The liability lies with the individual in such an event and the null community cannot be held responsible.
* No infringement to the IPR or Copyright
* Don’t share any information which can damage the image and reputation of an individual, organization, state, or Government.
* Rumors are not knowledge sharing. Please verify the source of your knowledge before sharing it with the community.
	
### Sales and Marketing:
* NO SALES PITCH. You can contact the members one on one separately ONLY if that member shows his/her intention of buying any new solution; This group is only for knowledge sharing. We support each other without any commercial intention. We have not created this platform for sales lead, consulting and brand promotion;
* NO PRODUCT and/or SERVICE PROMOTION. No DIRECT or INDIRECT promotion of product or services in the group. 
* NO BRAND PROMOTION. Repeated sharing of publicly available information through a company’s URL by its employees or associates will be considered as brand promotion.

### Job Posts:
* OPEN POSITION. Announcement of open positions. The purpose of this group is not to engage in the solicitation of employment by its members. However, this group permits its members to post open position(s) along with an accurate point of contact for further discussion in order to avoid any further discussion within the group. Interested members should contact the point of contact separately outside the group and avoid any further discussion within the group; Please make use of [the null jobs forum](https://jobs.null.community/) for the purpose.
* JOB SEARCH. If a member has lost the job and needs help from the group, he/she can announce the same in the group and those who are willing to help can approach the help seeker personally. Job search with the purpose of job-hopping not allowed in the group;

### HYGIENE
* No jokes, 
* No chain forwards, 
* No noise or nuisance to be created within the group, 
* Discipline to be maintained with members and the group admin.
* No SPAMMING in the group. Sending very frequently or too much irrelevant information will be treated as spam.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
coc_incidents@null.community

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
